# Current-Mods
A list of all Mods currently in use in my main Minecraft instance.



| Mod Name | Description | Download Link | Notes |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Accurate Block Placement | Makes placing blocks easier | [1.0.13](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/accurate-block-placement/files/3825069) | May flag anti-cheat on some servers |
| Advanced Movement | Adds Quake-like movement tech | [22.08.20hotfix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-movement/files/3944811) | May flag anti-cheat on some servers |
| Advancement Plaques | Changes Advancement Toasts into large Plaques at the top of the screen | [1.4.5](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advancement-plaques-fabric/files/3847856)| Looks way nicer, but can get annoying, especially if you forget it's added |
| BetterF3 | Completely overhauls the F3 Menu, and allows tons of customization | [4.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterf3/version/4.0.0) | Download pages says 1.19.1/1.19.2, but it works on 1.19 properly |
| BlockMeterFabric | Allows measuring the size of anything in game using the selected tool/hotkey | [1.7-HEAD](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blockmeterfabric/files/3910838) | Slightly redundant if you have WorldEdit and like staring at little pink numbers, otherwise extremely useful |
| Camera Overhaul | Adds more camera rotations | [1.3.1](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cameraoverhaul/files/3960293) | Can be slightly disorienting, use at your own risk |
| Chroma Blocks | Adds chroma key blocks | [2.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/chromablocks/version/2.0.0-1.19.2) | Only useable in single player |
| Client Commands | Adds a variety of fun and useful commands that can be used anywhere | [2.7.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/client-commands/version/2.7.1) | |
| Cloth Config API | Library for Menu Screens | [8.2.88](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config/version/8.2.88+fabric) | I don't remember which Mod(s) requires this, but it is required for something... |
| Cursor Mod | Adds a highly customizable cursor | [1.3.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/cursormod/version/1.3.2-1.19-20220702) | Very nice when used in conjunction with a Grey or Dark mode texture pack |
| Custom Crosshair | Adds highly customizable crosshairs | [1.5.0](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-crosshair-mod/files/3856766) | Modrinth for some reason doesn't list the 1.19 version of this mod |
| Custom Splash Screen | Allows editing what the splash screen looks like when you launch Minecraft | [1.2.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/custom-splash-screen/version/1.2.0) | Annoyingly has no option to preview changes, so you may have to relaunch MC several times before you're satisfied with your adjustments |
| Diagonal Panes | Makes Glass Panes, Stained Glass Panes and Iron Bars work diagonally instead of making weird 90Â° turns | [0.6.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/diagonal-panes/version/0.6.2) | This one is really personal preference, and could even be labeled slightly cursed |
| Disguise Heads | Changes your skin to match the head when wearing player heads | [1.0.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/disguiseheads/version/v1.0.2-1.19-fabric) | |
| Draggable Resource Packs | Lets you drag resource packs into place | [3.0.1](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/draggable-resource-packs/files/3935493) | Do you think the default arrow buttons are retarded and slow? Yeah me too. Use this mod instead! |
| Fabric API | Essential hooks for modding with Fabric. | [0.58.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/version/0.58.0+1.19) | If you don't already have this, something is wrong |
| FerriteCore | Reduces Memory Usage | [5.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core/version/5.0.0-fabric) | Should be compatible with most performance mods, but always check anyway |
| ForgeConfigAPIPort | Adds in the Forge Config API | [4.2.6](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-config-api-port-fabric/files/3960064) | Similar to Cloth Config API I don't remember what needed this, only that something did |
| Iceberg | Modding library | [1.0.46](https://modrinth.com/mod/iceberg/version/1.0.46) | Needed by a few Mods |
| ImmediatelyFast | Speeds up immediate rendering mode | [1.0.4](https://modrinth.com/mod/immediatelyfast/version/1.0.4) | TL;DR it helps FPS |
| Indium | Adds support for the Fabric Rendering API into Sodium | [1.0.7](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium/version/1.0.7+mc1.19) | |

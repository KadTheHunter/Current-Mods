A list of all Mods currently in use in my main Minecraft instance.



| Mod Name | Description | Download Link | Notes |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Accurate Block Placement | Makes placing blocks easier | [1.0.13](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/accurate-block-placement/files/3825069) | May flag anti-cheat on some servers |
| Advanced Movement | Adds Quake-like movement tech | [22.08.20hotfix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-movement/files/3944811) | May flag anti-cheat on some servers |
| Advancement Plaques | Changes Advancement Toasts into large Plaques at the top of the screen | [1.4.5](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advancement-plaques-fabric/files/3847856)| Looks way nicer, but can get annoying, especially if you forget it's added |
| BetterF3 | Completely overhauls the F3 Menu, and allows tons of customization | [4.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterf3/version/4.0.0) | Download pages says 1.19.1/1.19.2, but it works on 1.19 properly |
| BlockMeterFabric | Allows measuring the size of anything in game using the selected tool/hotkey | [1.7-HEAD](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blockmeterfabric/files/3910838) | Slightly redundant if you have WorldEdit and like staring at little pink numbers, otherwise extremely useful |
| Camera Overhaul | Adds more camera rotations | [1.3.1](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cameraoverhaul/files/3960293) | Can be slightly disorienting, use at your own risk |
| Chroma Blocks | Adds chroma key blocks | [2.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/chromablocks/version/2.0.0-1.19.2) | Only useable in single player |
| Client Commands | Adds a variety of fun and useful commands that can be used anywhere | [2.7.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/client-commands/version/2.7.1) | |
| Cloth Config API | Library for Menu Screens | [8.2.88](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config/version/8.2.88+fabric) | I don't remember which Mod(s) requires this, but it is required for something... |
| Cursor Mod | Adds a highly customizable cursor | [1.3.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/cursormod/version/1.3.2-1.19-20220702) | Very nice when used in conjunction with a Grey or Dark mode texture pack |
| Custom Crosshair | Adds highly customizable crosshairs | [1.5.0](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-crosshair-mod/files/3856766) | Modrinth for some reason doesn't list the 1.19 version of this mod |
| Custom Splash Screen | Allows editing what the splash screen looks like when you launch Minecraft | [1.2.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/custom-splash-screen/version/1.2.0) | Annoyingly has no option to preview changes, so you may have to relaunch MC several times before you're satisfied with your adjustments |
| Diagonal Panes | Makes Glass Panes, Stained Glass Panes and Iron Bars work diagonally instead of making weird 90Â° turns | [0.6.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/diagonal-panes/version/0.6.2) | This one is really personal preference, and could even be labeled slightly cursed |
| Disguise Heads | Changes your skin to match the head when wearing player heads | [1.0.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/disguiseheads/version/v1.0.2-1.19-fabric) | |
| Draggable Resource Packs | Lets you drag resource packs into place | [3.0.1](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/draggable-resource-packs/files/3935493) | Do you think the default arrow buttons are retarded and slow? Yeah me too. Use this mod instead! |
| Fabric API | Essential hooks for modding with Fabric. | [0.58.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/version/0.58.0+1.19) | If you don't already have this, something is wrong |
| FerriteCore | Reduces Memory Usage | [5.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core/version/5.0.0-fabric) | Should be compatible with most performance mods, but always check anyway |
| ForgeConfigAPIPort | Adds in the Forge Config API | [4.2.6](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-config-api-port-fabric/files/3960064) | Similar to Cloth Config API I don't remember what needed this, only that something did |
| Iceberg | Modding library | [1.0.46](https://modrinth.com/mod/iceberg/version/1.0.46) | Needed by a few Mods |
| ImmediatelyFast | Speeds up immediate rendering mode | [1.0.4](https://modrinth.com/mod/immediatelyfast/version/1.0.4) | TL;DR it helps FPS |
| Indium | Adds support for the Fabric Rendering API into Sodium | [1.0.7](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium/version/1.0.7+mc1.19) | |
| Iris | Shader mod for Minecraft that works with Sodium | [1.2.6](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris/version/1.19.x-v1.2.6) | I recommend Sildurs Vibrant Shaders for general use |
| Isometric Renders | Creates high-resolution isometric screenshots of game objects | [0.4.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/isometric-renders/version/0.4.1+1.19) | Insanely cool tool |
| LazyDFU | Makes the game load faster | [0.1.3](https://modrinth.com/mod/lazydfu/version/0.1.3) | |
| Litematica | Renders schematics in-game, and allows pasting or easy-placing them | [0.12.0](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica/files/3909399) | Incredibly useful, but many guides online are outdated |
| Log Cleaner | Cleans out old, unused log files | [1.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/log-cleaner/version/1.0.0) | |
| MaLiLib | Library used by several mods, notably Litematica | [0.13.0](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib/files/3870801) | |
| Map-In-Slot | Renders maps when in inventory slots | [1.0.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/map-in-slot/version/1.0.2) | Very very useful when working with mapart |
| Memory Leak Fix | Fixes random memory leaks that can occur | [0.7.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/memoryleakfix/version/v0.7.0-1.19) | |
| Meteor Client | Adds tons of utilities and even hacks, including Baritone | [0.5.0](https://meteorclient.com/download) | Adds a shit-ton of things, accesible via the Meteor Client Menu. Ever wanted a hacked client, without having to use a hacked client? This is it. *If the download is for a version after 1.19.0, open an issue in this repo and I'll fix it. Their website doesn't have a way to link to a specific version, so the current version is linked instead* |
| Minecraft Capes | Allows the use of Custom Capes and Elytra | [12.0.4](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minecraftcapes-mod/files/3873642) | Requires an account on [minecraftcapes.net](https://minecraftcapes.net/), but is totally worth it. Seen my custom elytra on stream? This is how I got it |
| Model Dumper | Dump rendered models as .obj files | [1.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/modeldumper/version/1.0.0-fabric) | Not very useful for the average player, but pretty cool |
| Mod Menu | Adds a menu in-game to view your Mods and edit configs where available | [4.0.4](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/version/4.0.4) | I pity the fool who doesn't use this mod |
| Mod Settings | Adds a menu in-game to edit Mod settings | [1.1.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/mod-settings/version/1.1.0+1.19) | It's literally a stripped down ModMenu, just for Mod Configs/Settings |
| Nameless Servers | Allows the name field for servers to be blank | [1.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/nameless-servers/version/v1.0.0+1.19) | |
| No Chat Reports | Makes chat unreportable where possible | [1.2.3](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports/version/Fabric-1.19-v1.2.3) | Not really needed on 1.19.0, but I still use it anyway |
| No Creative Drift | Allows toggling the intensity of Drift when flying in Creative Mode | [4.0.4.0](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nocreativedrift/files/3830375) | Sick of sliding a block and a half when you stop flying? Yeah me too. Use this mod, and spare your sanity. Personal preference is to set it to 'Weak' |
| No More Purple | Allows choosing a custom enchantment glint color | [1.0.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-more-purple/version/1.0.1+1.19) | |
| Notif Mod | Plays a sound when certain things happen in game | [1.3](https://modrinth.com/mod/notifmod/version/1.3) | I personally use it to track Joins/Leaves on servers, but it has a much broader usage range than that |
| Organized Tabs | Re-organizes the Creative Inventory to be more logical | [1.0.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/organized-tabs/version/1.0.1_1.19) | Small QoL change, but holy shit is it awesome to have |
| owo Library | Particles, automatic registry and general utility lib | [0.8.5](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib/version/0.8.5+1.19) | No the name is not related to its purpose, yes it is needed for another mod to function
| Pick Block Pro | Advanced block picker that allows picking NBT, etc as well | [1.6.12](https://modrinth.com/mod/pick-block-pro/version/1.6.12) | Useful when doing things with Shulkers and Kits in Creative |

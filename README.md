# Current-Mods
A list of all Mods currently in use in my main Minecraft instance.
Requires Fabric Loader 0.14.10

If a mods current/linked version is for a version of Minecraft newer than 1.19.0, or if the notes mention Special JARs, check the [Special JARs](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/Current-Mods/tree/master/Special%20JARs) folder, as it has versions for 1.19 that aren't available elsewhere (because some groups are twats and won't even list old versions-- looking at you Meteor Client), or else are versions modified to work with other mods (such as the special version of Sodium that works with ReplayMod).


| Mod Name | Description | Download Link | Notes |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Accurate Block Placement | Makes placing blocks easier | [1.0.13](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/accurate-block-placement/files/3825069) | May flag anti-cheat on some servers |
| Advancement Plaques | Changes Advancement Toasts into large Plaques at the top of the screen | [1.4.5](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advancement-plaques-fabric/files/3847856)| Looks way nicer, but can get annoying, especially if you forget it's added |
| BetterF3 | Completely overhauls the F3 Menu, and allows tons of customization | [4.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterf3/version/4.0.0) | Download pages says 1.19.1/1.19.2, but it works on 1.19 properly |
| BlockMeterFabric | Allows measuring the size of anything in game using the selected tool/hotkey | [1.7-HEAD](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blockmeterfabric/files/3910838) | Slightly redundant if you have WorldEdit and like staring at little pink numbers, otherwise extremely useful |
| Camera Overhaul | Adds more camera rotations | [1.3.1](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cameraoverhaul/files/3960293) | Can be slightly disorienting, use at your own risk |
| Chroma Blocks | Adds chroma key blocks | [2.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/chromablocks/version/2.0.0-1.19.2) | Only useable in single player |
| Client Commands | Adds a variety of fun and useful commands that can be used anywhere | [2.7.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/client-commands/version/2.7.1) | |
| Cloth Config API | Library for Menu Screens | [8.2.88](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config/version/8.2.88+fabric) | I don't remember which Mod(s) requires this, but it is required for something... |
| Cursor Mod | Adds a highly customizable cursor | [1.3.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/cursormod/version/1.3.2-1.19-20220702) | Very nice when used in conjunction with a Grey or Dark mode texture pack |
| Custom Crosshair | Adds highly customizable crosshairs | [1.5.0](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-crosshair-mod/files/3856766) | Modrinth for some reason doesn't list the 1.19 version of this mod |
| Custom Splash Screen | Allows editing what the splash screen looks like when you launch Minecraft | [1.2.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/custom-splash-screen/version/1.2.0) | Annoyingly has no option to preview changes, so you may have to relaunch MC several times before you're satisfied with your adjustments |
| Diagonal Panes | Makes Glass Panes, Stained Glass Panes and Iron Bars work diagonally instead of making weird 90Â° turns | [0.6.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/diagonal-panes/version/0.6.2) | This one is really personal preference, and could even be labeled slightly cursed |
| Disguise Heads | Changes your skin to match the head when wearing player heads | [1.0.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/disguiseheads/version/v1.0.2-1.19-fabric) | |
| Draggable Resource Packs | Lets you drag resource packs into place | [3.0.1](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/draggable-resource-packs/files/3935493) | Do you think the default arrow buttons are retarded and slow? Yeah me too. Use this mod instead! |
| Emotecraft | Adds Emotes into Minecraft | [2.2.5](https://modrinth.com/mod/emotecraft/version/2.2.5-MC1.19.2-fabric) | Very fun, but other players won't see you emoting unless the server has it as well |
| Fabric API | Essential hooks for modding with Fabric. | [0.58.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/version/0.58.0+1.19) | If you don't already have this, something is wrong |
| FerriteCore | Reduces Memory Usage | [5.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core/version/5.0.0-fabric) | Should be compatible with most performance mods, but always check anyway |
| ForgeConfigAPIPort | Adds in the Forge Config API | [4.2.6](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-config-api-port-fabric/files/3960064) | Similar to Cloth Config API I don't remember what needed this, only that something did |
| Hotbars+ | Allows unlimited Hotbar saves, by paginating the vanilla system | [2.0-pre4](https://github.com/VideoGameSmash12/HotbarsPlus/releases/tag/v2.0-pre4) | Incredibly useful for transporting mass amounts of Shulker Kits and Custom Items |
| Iceberg | Modding library | [1.0.46](https://modrinth.com/mod/iceberg/version/1.0.46) | Needed by a few Mods |
| ImmediatelyFast | Speeds up immediate rendering mode | [1.0.5](https://modrinth.com/mod/immediatelyfast/version/1.0.5) | TL;DR it helps FPS |
| Indium | Adds support for the Fabric Rendering API into Sodium | [1.0.7](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium/version/1.0.7+mc1.19) | |
| Iris | Shader mod for Minecraft that works with Sodium | [1.2.6](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris/version/1.19.x-v1.2.6) | I recommend Sildurs Vibrant Shaders for general use |
| Isometric Renders | Creates high-resolution isometric screenshots of game objects | [0.4.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/isometric-renders/version/0.4.1+1.19) | Insanely cool tool |
| LazyDFU | Makes the game load faster | [0.1.3](https://modrinth.com/mod/lazydfu/version/0.1.3) | |
| Litematica | Renders schematics in-game, and allows pasting or easy-placing them | [0.12.1](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica/files/4259738) | Incredibly useful, but many guides online are outdated |
| Log Cleaner | Cleans out old, unused log files | [1.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/log-cleaner/version/1.0.0) | |
| MaLiLib | Library used by several mods, notably Litematica | [0.13.0](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib/files/3870801) | |
| Map-In-Slot | Renders maps when in inventory slots | [1.0.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/map-in-slot/version/1.0.2) | Very very useful when working with mapart |
| Memory Leak Fix | Fixes random memory leaks that can occur | [0.7.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/memoryleakfix/version/v0.7.0-1.19) | |
| Meteor Client | Adds tons of utilities and even hacks, including Baritone | [0.5.0](https://meteorclient.com/download) | Adds a shit-ton of things, accesible via the Meteor Client Menu. Ever wanted a hacked client, without having to use a hacked client? This is it. *Meteor Client devs are twats who refuse to even list older versions of the Mod anywhere, so I've uploaded my copy of Meteor 0.5.0 for 1.19 into the Special Jars folder in this repo.* |
| Meteor Rejects Addon | Adds various modules and commands rejected by the main Meteor Client | [0.2](https://github.com/AntiCope/meteor-rejects/releases/tag/latest-1.19) | Mostly useful on Survival worlds, but has some good utilities overall |
| Meteor Litematica Printer | Adds a module to print Litematica schematics | [1.1](https://github.com/kkllffaa/meteor-litematica-printer/releases/tag/latest) | Not as good as just easy-placing builds, but far superior to other printer mods |
| Meteor Starscript ID | Adds Item IDs into Starscript | [1.0](https://github.com/RacoonDog/starscript-item-id/releases/tag/latest) | I use a 1.19 version of this, which is basically identical, I just adjusted the `fabric.mod.json` and `gradle.properties` and recompiled it. That version can be found in the Special JARs folder of this repo.|
| Minecraft Capes | Allows the use of Custom Capes and Elytra | [12.0.4](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minecraftcapes-mod/files/3873642) | Requires an account on [minecraftcapes.net](https://minecraftcapes.net/), but is totally worth it. Seen my custom elytra on stream? This is how I got it |
| Model Dumper | Dump rendered models as .obj files | [1.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/modeldumper/version/1.0.0-fabric) | Not very useful for the average player, but pretty cool |
| Mod Menu | Adds a menu in-game to view your Mods and edit configs where available | [4.0.4](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/version/4.0.4) | I pity the fool who doesn't use this mod |
| Mod Settings | Adds a menu in-game to edit Mod settings | [1.1.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/mod-settings/version/1.1.0+1.19) | It's literally a stripped down ModMenu, just for Mod Configs/Settings |
| Nameless Servers | Allows the name field for servers to be blank | [1.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/nameless-servers/version/v1.0.0+1.19) | |
| No Chat Reports | Makes chat unreportable where possible | [1.2.3](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports/version/Fabric-1.19-v1.2.3) | Not really needed on 1.19.0, but I still use it anyway |
| No Creative Drift | Allows toggling the intensity of Drift when flying in Creative Mode | [4.0.4.0](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nocreativedrift/files/3830375) | Sick of sliding a block and a half when you stop flying? Yeah me too. Use this mod, and spare your sanity. Personal preference is to set it to 'Weak' |
| No More Purple | Allows choosing a custom enchantment glint color | [1.0.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-more-purple/version/1.0.1+1.19) | |
| Notif Mod | Plays a sound when certain things happen in game | [1.3](https://modrinth.com/mod/notifmod/version/1.3) | I personally use it to track Joins/Leaves on servers, but it has a much broader usage range than that |
| Organized Tabs | Re-organizes the Creative Inventory to be more logical | [1.0.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/organized-tabs/version/1.0.1_1.19) | Small QoL change, but holy shit is it awesome to have |
| owo Library | Particles, automatic registry and general utility lib | [0.8.5](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib/version/0.8.5+1.19) | No the name is not related to its purpose, yes it is needed for another mod to function
| Pick Block Pro | Advanced block picker that allows picking NBT, etc as well | [1.6.12](https://modrinth.com/mod/pick-block-pro/version/1.6.12) | Useful when doing things with Shulkers and Kits in Creative |
| PictureSign | Use signs to display pictures from the web completely client-side | [1.4.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/picturesign/version/1.4.1) | Not as good as using EpsilonBot for Mapart on TotalFreedom, but still sick |
| ReplayMod | Lets you record in-game | [2.6.8](https://modrinth.com/mod/replaymod/version/1.19-2.6.8) | Requires a special version of Sodium rather than standard Sodium, the special version  can be found in the Special JARs folder of this repo. |
| SignTools | Lots of Sign-related tools and utilities | [1.0.0](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sign-tools/files/3824136) | |
| Skin Swapper | Allows you to swap skins in-game | [3.1.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/skinswapper/version/3.12) | Extremely useful, seeing as Microjang doesn't have the decency to add such a basic feature |
| Sneaky | Lets you stay sneaking when opening chests/inventory/menus | [1.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/sneaky/version/1.1) | Honestly more useful on PvP based servers where you may want to open something while staying hidden, but still a good QoL tweak |
| Sodium | Performance mod for Minecraft | [0.4.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium/version/mc1.19-0.4.2) | This is the official release of Sodium for 1.19, but it won't work with ReplayMod. The compatible version can be found on [ReplayMods website](https://www.replaymod.com/download/), or in the Special JARs folder of this repo. |
| SongPlayer | Lets you play Songs in MIDI format on Noteblocks | [2.0.0](https://github.com/hhhzzzsss/SongPlayer/releases/tag/v2.0.0) | Made by a member of Total Freedom, it's really good. |
| Spark | Performance profiler | [1.9.45](https://modrinth.com/mod/spark/version/1.9.45-fabric) | |
| SquakeFabric | Adds Quake style movement into Minecraft | [1.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/squakefabric/version/1.1+1.19) | This mod combined with Camera Overhaul is incredibly addicting, and once you get used to it, there's no going back |
| Symbol Chat | Adds a Symbol/Emoji menu in chat, as well as a Font menu | [0.3.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/symbol-chat/version/0.3.1) | Ever wanted to use that one symbol, but didn't know how to get it? Or ever just wanted to write in Australian (upside down) to annoy your friends? This mod lets you |
| Technopig | Name any pig 'Technoblade' to give it a crown on it's head | [1.0.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/technomodel/version/v1.0.1) | R.I.P Technoblade |
| ToolTipFix | Prevents Tooltips from running off screen | [1.1.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/tooltipfix/version/1.1.0-1.19) | This is pretty much a requirement if you plan on working with NBT on items to add custom Lore and stuff |
| Visible Barriers | Allows you to toggle the visibility of Barriers, Light Blocks, and other Map Making Utilities with a hotkey, as well as adds them into the creative inventory | [1.5.3](https://modrinth.com/mod/visible-barriers/version/1.5.3+1.19.x) | If you use these blocks, or play on a server that allows them, you need this |
| Weather Changer | Changes the weather client-side | [0.1.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/weather-changer/version/0.1.0) | Really nice for when you want to take a screenshot or recording on a server, but don't have access to the weather commands |
| World Edit | ...It's World Edit... | [7.2.11-Beta2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit/files/3903074) | |
| Xaero's Minimap | Adds a minimap in-game, with customizable position and data | [22.12.0](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap/files/3876771) | |
| Xaero's Worldmap | Adds a World Map accessible via hotkey | [1.26.1](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-world-map/files/3876752) | |
| Xanders Sodium Options | Changes the Sodium settings menu to a more vanilla style | [1.0.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/xanders-sodium-options/version/1.0.2) | |
| YetAnotherConfigLib | Builded-based configuration library | [1.7.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl/version/1.7.1) | Again, I don't know which Mod requires this, but something does or did |

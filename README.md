# Current-Mods
A list of all Mods currently in use in my main Minecraft instance.



| Mod Name | Description | Download Link | Notes |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Accurate Block Placement | Makes placing blocks easier | [1.0.13](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/accurate-block-placement/files/3825069) | May flag anti-cheat on some servers |
| Advanced Movement | Adds Quake-like movement tech | [22.08.20hotfix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-movement/files/3944811) | May flag anti-cheat on some servers |
| Advancement Plaques | Changes Advancement Toasts into large Plaques at the top of the screen | [1.4.5](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advancement-plaques-fabric/files/3847856)| Looks way nicer, but can get annoying, especially if you forget it's added |
| BetterF3 | Completely overhauls the F3 Menu, and allows tons of customization | [4.0.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterf3/version/4.0.0) | Download pages says 1.19.1/1.19.2, but it works on 1.19 properly |
| BlockMeterFabric | Allows measuring the size of anything in game using the selected tool/hotkey | [1.7-HEAD](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blockmeterfabric/files/3910838) | Slightly redundant if you have WorldEdit and like staring at little pink numbers, otherwise extremely useful |
